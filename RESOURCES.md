* git repository management commands: 
	* ``git diff <file>`` Displays the differences between your local repository and what is in the public repo
	* ``git reset`` Resets your local repository to the current working state. 
	* ``git reset --hard origin/master`` Resets your local repository changes to reflect the public repository and deletes any changes from your local repository.
	* ``git checkout -- <file>`` Resets local changes on <file> to reflect what is in the public repo.
	* ``git checkout <hash> <file>`` Rolls back changes on <file> to the commit with hash value <hash>
	* ``git fetch`` Gets changes from public repository, without merging them into the current working tree
	* ``git merge`` Merges two branches together.
	* ``git pull`` Automatically merges commits from the remote repository without letting you review them first
	* ``git branch -d <branch_name>`` Deletes a branch that has been merged.
	* ``git branch -D <branch_name>`` Force deletes a branch that has not been fully merged. May loose unmerged work!
	* ``git push origin --delete <branch_name`` Force deletes a branch locally and remote.
